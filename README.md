- 👋 Hi, I’m @renatorosati
- 👀 I’m interested in CNC machines
- 🌱 I’m currently learning CNC foam cutter and CNC laser cutter
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on how to unify the GRBL to work with both interchangeable modules (needle foam cutter and laser cutter). It would be helpful for the rc modelers around the world.
- 📫 How to reach me, email: renato.a.rosati@gmail.com
